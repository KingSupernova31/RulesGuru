The source code for [RulesGuru](http://rulesguru.net/), a resource for Magic judges.

Wizards of the Coast is constantly releasing more cards, often with new layouts and abilities that we want to support as soon as possible. Scalability and versatility are therefore a high priority for new features, and code should keep future maintainability in mind.

## Setup
To run a local version of RulesGuru, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14 or greater. Download the files from this repository and run `npm install` in that directory to install the required node modules. Then download and generate RulesGuru's data files with `node updateDataFiles.js`. (This has to download card data and will usually take several minutes.) You can then start all scripts running with `npm start` or run only the server with `node server.js`. (Note that the server takes around 30 seconds to start). To stop the full pm2 suite from running, use `npm stop`. To run all tests, simply use `npm test`.

Certain files in this repository contain placeholder data as detailed below:

* `emailCredentials.json` and `discordPassword.txt` do not contain real passwords, and your local application will encounter an error if it tries to use them. If you want to use that functionality, you'll need to supply your own email and/or Discord credentials.
* `admins.json` contains data for a single test admin. If you need admins with different permissions, start the server as described above, then navigate to `localhost:8080/question-editor`, log in to the owner account with password `correcthorsebatterystaple`, and use the admin editor to add/edit the desired admin accounts.
* `questionDatabase.db`, `public_html/globalResources/searchLinkMappings.js`, `public_html/searchLinkCardNamesDiff.js`, and `public_html/globalResources/allTags.js` are frequently and automatically updated on the live RulesGuru site. As such, the files in this repository are outdated versions of the live files. This may occasionally result in errors due to data mismatches when run locally. If this happens, let me know and I'll upload a newer version of them.
* The API that RulesGuru uses to fetch metagame data is private, so for development purposes we host a mirror of that data ourselves at the URLs in `mostPlayedApiUrls.json`. Please do not use this data for any other purpose.
* `logs/` and `backups/` are also (obviously) not up-to-date.
* `savedAnnouncements.js` has a placeholder announcement.
