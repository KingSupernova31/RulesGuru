let savedAnnouncements = {"Admin callout":"Kaldheim is (almost) upon us, and I'd like to thank our admin team for their hard work ever since Zendikar Rising. Ryan Sears and Tobias Vyseri in particular have been greatly appreciated, and I wrote up some personal recognitions for them which are visible on the RulesGuru home page. http://rulesguru.net/\n\nWe're looking for a few more people to join our admin team for Kaldheim season. Perks include stimulating rules discussions, cool foils, digital games of Judge's Tower, unexpected golf, custom RulesGuru judge bunnies, and more. For further information on getting involved, please see here: https://rulesguru.net/get-involved/\n\nAs always, if you don't feel like joining the team but still want to contribute, you can submit your own questions at https://rulesguru.net/submit/. We'd especially appreciate questions involving the new Kaldheim cards.\n\nThis last year has been a true saga of major events, and while I foretell that we may be faced (perhaps even doubly so) with even more challenges over the next few months, the Magic community boasts many wonderful people, and I just snow that we'll come though it stronger than ever.","New admin welcome":"Welcome everyone! Thank you all so much for applying to join our team. I've tried to put all of the information that you might need here:\n\nhttps://rulesguru.net/admin-information/\n\nThat page is pretty dense with information, so I'd love to go over the main editor features with you over Discord or Zoom, where I can share my screen and walk you through it. Just let me know what day and time works best for you, my schedule is completely open. (I'm thinking tomorrow?)\n\nThis chat is for the whole team to be able to communicate about anything related to RulesGuru (or just casual chat), so don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. :)","Admin goodbye":"Alright, it is now approaching the true end of Zendikar Rising. I really appreciate everyone's help over the past 3 months, and this season's recognitions are up on the home page. :) If anyone would like to stay on and remain active for Kaldheim seaon, let me know. Otherwise it looks like it's time to say goodbye. I am hugely thankful for all of your help, and you'll always be welcome back if you want to return some day.\n\nOnly two people have filled out the feedback form I posted a few days ago, so if you haven't done so yet, regardless of whether you're staying or leaving, I'd really appreciate it if you could take a moment to fill it out.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1v4QNEg3rlsfUhtX9mOd2hjSF6y264gl0MSasH4PW9ds","Recognition":"As Zendikar Rising season comes to an end, I would like to recognize Ryan Sears and Tobias Vyseri for all of their help over the past three months.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>I would like to recognize <b>Kyle Ryc</b> and <b>Andrew Villarrubia</b> for all of their help with the project.\n\t\t\t\t<br><br>\n\t\t\t\tKyle is a level 2 judge from Ontario who has been extremely enthusiastic about RulesGuru.
