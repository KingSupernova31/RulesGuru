							<h2>RulesGuru Recognitions</h2>
							<p>As Kaldheim approaches, I would like to recognize <b>Ryan Sears</b> and <b>Tobias Vyseri</b> for their contributions.
							<br><br>
							Ryan is a level 2 judge from Michigan and a moderator for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/358305221218820">Rules Day Tuesday</a> project, which helps teach MTG rules and policy to over 300 people. He's only been on the RulesGuru team for 3 months, but has already been a huge asset in that time. From suggesting new features for making the question approval process better, to offering to help manage the RulesGuru <a href="https://twitter.com/MTGRulesGuru">Twitter</a> account, to going back through old questions and updating their tags, he appears to leave no area untouched when he sees something that could be improved.
							<br><br>
							Tobi is a level 2 judge from British Columbia and was the first person to join the RulesGuru project. She's been steadfastly contributing for almost 2 years now, and in total has approved more than 300 questions. (Over a third of the entire database.) She's also a graphic designer by trade, and has contributed many of the icons and style choices that are currently in use on RulesGuru. She even designed some custom <a href="http://www.vyseri.com/judgebunny.html">Judge Bunnies</a> to be given out along with the judge promos for these recognitions.
							<br><br>
							A huge thank you to both Tobi and Ryan, along with the rest of our wonderful admin team. If you'd like to get involved yourself, anyone is welcome. More information is available <a href="../get-involved">here</a>.</p>
