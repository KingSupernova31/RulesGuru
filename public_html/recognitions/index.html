		<h4 class="header">Guillaume Vanel</h4>
		<p class="content">Guillaume is a judge and programmer from France who's been excited to play around with the intersection of those two hobbies. From his very clear and precise wording of questions, to his love of crafting complicated regular expressions to match specific rules text, to designing an exiting new (as-yet-unreleased) feature, his passion for technically-minded.</p>

		<h4 class="header">Ryan Sears</h4>
		<p class="content">Ryan is a level 2 judge from Michigan and a moderator for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/358305221218820">Rules Day Tuesday</a> project, which helps teach MTG rules and policy to over 300 people. He's only been on the RulesGuru team for 3 months, but has already been a huge asset in that time. From suggesting new features for making the question approval process better, to offering to help manage the RulesGuru <a href="https://twitter.com/MTGRulesGuru">Twitter</a> account, to going back through old questions and updating their tags, he appears to leave no area untouched when he sees something that could be improved.</p>
		<h4 class="header">Tobias Vyseri</h4>
		<p class="content">Tobi is a level 2 judge from British Columbia and was the first person to join the RulesGuru project. She's been steadfastly contributing for almost 2 years now, and in total has approved more than 300 questions. (Over a third of the entire database.) She's also a graphic designer by trade, and has contributed many of the icons and style choices that are currently in use on RulesGuru. She even designed some custom <a href="http://www.vyseri.com/judgebunny.html">Judge Bunnies</a> to be given out along with the judge promos for these recognitions.</p>

		<h4 class="header">Kyle Ryc</h4>
		<p class="content">Kyle is a level 2 judge from Ontario who has been extremely enthusiastic about RulesGuru. Last year at an event, before he was formally a part of the project, he accosted me with inquiries about how best to format a question. He's provided numerous suggestions to improve the website, and was even the inspiration for this very recognition system!</p>
		<h4 class="header">Andrew Villarrubia</h4>
		<p class="content">Andrew is a level 2 judge from Louisiana who maintains <a href="http://vensersjournal.com/">Venser's Journal</a>. An incredible standalone resource that also provides RulesGuru with programmatically accessible rules, letting us display those wonderful rules citation tooltips. Andrew has also been active in the <a href="https://chat.magicjudges.org/mtgrules/">rules question IRC channel</a> and has been a point of contact for people with questions or feedback about RulesGuru.</p>
