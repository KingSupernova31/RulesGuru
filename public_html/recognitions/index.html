		<h1>Recognitions</h1>

		<h4 class="header">Gurshaan Sidhu</h4>
		<p class="content">Gurshaan is a level 1 judge from British Columbia. I had the pleasure of certifying him a few months ago, and he dove into judging with a passion. He's become a staple of the Judge Academy Discord server rules channel, and he joined the RulesGuru team shortly afterwards. In addition to many insightful questions and suggestions to help us improve our process, he's also contributed over 60 questions himself and is still going strong.</p>
		<h4 class="header">Ludwig Scheuring</h4>
		<p class="content">Ludwig is a level 1 judge from Germany who absolutely <b>loves</b> rules puzzles. For example, do you know how can you add mana to your mana pool while in the 'paying costs' step of casting a spell?. I didn't. His encyclopedic knowledge of Magic's card pool and all sorts of rules corner cases has been a wonderful asset to the project, and I'm eager to think about whatever crazy situation he comes up with next.</p>
		<br>
		<h2><img class="setSymbol" src="AFR.png"/> Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms <img class="setSymbol" src="AFR.png"/></h2>
		<h4 class="header">Federico Abella</h4>
		<p class="content">Federico is a judge from Uruguay who joined us 3 months ago. He's one of our "Grammar Gurus", helping make sure typos don't slip through to finished questions. He's also been very active in our discord server, helping other members of the team improve their writing skills and starting interesting discussions about question design. Thank you for being a part of the team Federico!</p>

		<h2><img class="setSymbol" src="STX.png"/> Strixhaven <img class="setSymbol" src="STX.png"/></h2>
		<h4 class="header">Guillaume Vanel</h4>
		<p class="content">Guillaume is a judge from France who's found RulesGuru to be a way to merge his passions for Magic and for programming. What really stands out about his questions is his clear and precise wording along with his masterfully-crafted regular expressions to match specific rules text. He's also been designing an exciting new feature that should be going live soon. He's a valued member of the project and I look forward to continuing to work with him.</p>
		<br>
		<h2><img class="setSymbol" src="KHM.png"/> Kaldheim <img class="setSymbol" src="KHM.png"/></h2>
		<h4 class="header">Ryan Sears</h4>
		<p class="content">Ryan is a level 2 judge from Michigan and a moderator for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/358305221218820">Rules Day Tuesday</a> project, which helps teach MTG rules and policy to over 300 people. He's only been on the RulesGuru team for 3 months, but has already been a huge asset in that time. From suggesting new features for making the question approval process better, to offering to help manage the RulesGuru <a href="https://twitter.com/MTGRulesGuru">Twitter</a> account, to going back through old questions and updating their tags, he appears to leave no area untouched when he sees something that could be improved.</p>
		<h4 class="header">Tobias Vyseri</h4>
		<p class="content">Tobi is a level 2 judge from British Columbia and was the first person to join the RulesGuru project. She's been steadfastly contributing for almost 2 years now, and in total has approved more than 300 questions. (Over a third of the entire database.) She's also a graphic designer by trade, and has contributed many of the icons and style choices that are currently in use on RulesGuru. She even designed some custom <a href="http://www.vyseri.com/judgebunny.html">Judge Bunnies</a> to be given out along with the judge promos for these recognitions.</p>
		<br>
		<h2><img class="setSymbol" src="ZNR.png"/> Zendikar Rising <img class="setSymbol" src="ZNR.png"/></h2>
		<h4 class="header">Kyle Ryc</h4>
		<p class="content">Kyle is a level 2 judge from Ontario who has been extremely enthusiastic about RulesGuru. Last year at an event, before he was formally a part of the project, he accosted me with inquiries about how best to format a question. He's provided numerous suggestions to improve the website, and was even the inspiration for this very recognition system!</p>
		<h4 class="header">Andrew Villarrubia</h4>
		<p class="content">Andrew is a level 2 judge from Louisiana who maintains <a href="http://vensersjournal.com/">Venser's Journal</a>. An incredible standalone resource that also provides RulesGuru with programmatically accessible rules, letting us display those wonderful rules citation tooltips. Andrew has also been active in the <a href="https://chat.magicjudges.org/mtgrules/">rules question IRC channel</a> and has been a point of contact for people with questions or feedback about RulesGuru.</p>
