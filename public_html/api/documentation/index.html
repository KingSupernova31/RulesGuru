				<h1>RulesGuru API</h1>

				<p>The RulesGuru API provides a way for developers to access rules questions programmatically. Requests should be submitted to /api/questions/ as a GET request with parameter "json=[settings]", where "[settings]" is percent-encoded JSON. The properties of the JSON object are explained in the table below. Any omitted properties will be assumed to be the default in the right column.</p>

				<p>If your request string is malformed or you request more questions than are contained in the database, you'll get an error.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>The RulesGuru server has to perform a large number of computations in order to find questions that match some parameters. In order to not overload the server, please limit requests to one at a time, with a minimum delay of 100 milliseconds in between each request. In other words, do not submit multiple concurrent requests; wait for one to return, then wait 100 milliseconds, then submit another request. If you need multiple questions all of the same settings, submit a single request with the appropriate "count" variable; do not submit that many individual requests.</p>
				<br>
				<p>This API is a work in progress, meaning features and syntax may change. If you have any feature requests or bug reports, please let us know via our <button class="inline" id="questionIssueButton">contact form</button> or on <a href="https://github.com/KingSupernova31/RulesGuru">Github</a>.</p>
