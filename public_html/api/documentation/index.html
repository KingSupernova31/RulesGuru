				<h1>RulesGuru API</h1>

				<p>The RulesGuru API provides a way for developers to access rules questions programmatically. Requests should be submitted to /api/questions/ as a GET request with parameter "json=[settings]", where "[settings]" is percent-encoded JSON. The properties of the JSON object are explained in the table below. Any omitted properties will be assumed to be the default in the right column.</p>

				<div class="grid grid4">
					<p class="header">Property</p>
					<p class="header">Data Type</p>
					<p class="header">Description</p>
					<p class="header">Default Value</p>
					<p>count</p>
					<p>Number</p>
					<p>The number of questions you want.</p>
					<p>1</p>
					<p>level</p>
					<p>Array of strings (order-agnostic)</p>
					<p>Length 1 to 5, contains any combination of acceptable levels. Options are "0", "1", "2", "3", and "Corner Case".</p>
					<p>["0", "1", "2"]</p>
					<p>complexity</p>
					<p>Array of strings (order-agnostic)</p>

					<p>["Simple", "Intermediate"]</p>
					<p>legality</p>

					<p>Can be "Standard", "Pioneer", "Modern", "All of Magic", or "Choose Expansions".</p>
					<p>"Modern"</p>
					<p>expansions</p>
					<p>Array of strings (order-agnostic)</p>
					<p>Only used if legality is "Choose Expansions". Refer to the dropdown menu in the sidebar on the home page for a list of all available expansions.</p>
					<p>[]</p>
					<p>playableOnly</p>
					<p>Boolean</p>
					<p>If true, questions will be limited to cards that see tournament play in the given format. Ignored if legality is "All of Magic" or "Choose Expansions".</p>
					<p>false</p>
					<p>tags</p>
					<p>Array of strings (order-agnostic)</p>
					<p>A list of tags. Refer to the dropdown menu in the sidebar on the home page for a list of all available tags.</p>
					<p>["Unsupported answers"]</p>
					<p>rules</p>
					<p>Array of strings (order-agnostic)</p>
					<p>A list of rules. Refer to the dropdown menu in the sidebar on the home page for a list of all available rules. Or, you know, the CR.</p>
					<p>[]</p>
					<p>cards</p>
					<p>Array of strings (order-agnostic)</p>
					<p>A list of cards. Refer to the dropdown menu in the sidebar on the home page for a list of all available cards. Or, you know, Scryfall.</p>
					<p>[]</p>
					<p>tagsConjunc</p>
					<p>String</p>
					<p>The logical conjunction to be used upon the list of tags. Can be "AND", "OR", or "NOT".</p>
					<p>"NOT"</p>
					<p>rulesConjunc</p>
					<p>String</p>
					<p>The logical conjunction to be used upon the list of rules. Can be "AND", "OR", or "NOT".</p>
					<p>"OR"</p>
					<p>cardsConjunc</p>
					<p>String</p>
					<p>The logical conjunction to be used upon the list of cards. Can be "AND", "OR", or "NOT".</p>
					<p>"OR"</p>
					<p>previousId</p>
					<p>Number</p>
					<p>If this is specified, the returned questions will not be random. Instead they'll be the next X questions that match the given settings that come after the given id. (Wrapping back around to 1 one the end is reached.)</p>
					<p>undefined</p>
					<p>id</p>
					<p>Number</p>
					<p>The ID of a specific question you want to return. If this property is specified, only that question is returned, and most other fields are ignored. Legality, expansions, playableOnly, cards, and cardsConjunc will still be followed if possible. If any of those fields are left undefined, the defaults will be set to the most permissive option rather than the ones listed in this table.</p>
					<p>undefined</p>

				<p>Here is an example JSON string:</p>

				<div id="jsonWrapper">

				<p>Finding questions that match the given parameters is computationally expensive, so requests are rate-limited to one every 2 seconds. If you need multiple questions of the same settings, submit a single request with the appropriate "count" variable rather than submitting that many individual requests.</p>
