			<h4 class="header">What is RulesGuru?</h4>
				<div class="content">
					<p>RulesGuru is a searchable database of <b>Magic: The Gathering</b> rules questions that anyone can contribute to. With an ever-expanding and constantly-updated question pool, you can find everything from the easiest Standard questions to the most complicated of corner cases here.</p>
					<p>Each question is extensively tagged and categorized, allowing you to tailor the questions you're given to your exact purpose. The available filters include difficulty, format legality, cards used in the question, and the area of the rules that's being asked about. Detailed descriptions of each filter can be found by hovering over the appropriate section of the sidebar accessible in the upper left of the <a href="..">home page</a>.</p>
					<p>If you're looking for programmatically-accessible questions, see our <a href="/api/documentation">API</a>.</p>
					<p>We also have a series of <a href="/courses">courses</a> on the rules, and a <a href="https://discord.gg/Mwknxg3drr">Discord server</a> for discussion of Magic's rules.</p>
			</div>

			<h4 class="header">Questions about Questions?</h4>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Player names that start with "A" are the active player; that is, the player currently taking their turn. Player names that start with any other letter are nonactive players. (In multiplayer the nonactive player names will start with "B", "C", "D", etc. to indicate turn order.) If the question spans multiple turns, the players' names do not change as new turns begin.</p>
					<p>Questions will always refer to an object by its original name, regardless of any changes caused by game effects. For example if a Clone enters the battlefield and copies Grizzly Bears, the question will still refer to it as "Clone" in order to distinguish it from the original Grizzly Bears.</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise stated, the following things are true:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It is a two-player game of normal Magic.</li>
						<li>Nothing else has happened prior this turn, except for things that must normally happen, like drawing for turn.</li>
						<li>Nothing is atypical about the game state. There are no secret continuous effects or delayed triggers, it's not the first turn of the game, the library isn't empty, any permanent that's mentioned as being on the battlefield didn't enter this turn, etc.</li>
						<li>The only relevant cards in any non-library game zone are those that have been mentioned by name, along with any that need to exist for the question to make sense. (For example, if the question has a player casting a targeted spell, you can assume there's a legal target on the battlefield.)</li>
					</ul>

			<h4 class="header">Want to Help?</h4>
			<div class="content">
				<p>RulesGuru functions similarly to a wiki, in that anyone can contribute to the data that's available for everyone else. With the community's help the question pool can be as large as possible and include questions about new cards as soon as they're spoiled. You can easily submit questions of your own by heading <a href="../submit">here</a> and typing in your question. Once submitted, questions will be reviewed for accuracy by our team of admins and then approved into the site database.</p>
				<p>If you're interested in joining our admin team, we'd love to have you. See <a class="inline" href="../get-involved">here</a> for more information.</p>
				<p>If you find a bug or have a feature suggestion, please <button class="inline" id="contactFormTextLink">let us know</button> as soon as possible.</p>
				<p>To keep up with new features and announcements, <a href="https://twitter.com/MTGRulesGuru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"> follow us on Twitter.</a></p>

			<h4 class="header">Booth Mode</h4>
			<div class="content">
				<p>RulesGuru has a "booth mode", for player outreach at large events. You can type "booth" on the homepage (or on any question), and the site will prompt you for a number of questions to include in the "test". You'll then be given buttons to mark answers as correct or incorrect, and a final score at the end.</p>
				<p>There are also keyboard shortcuts to facilitate usage if you're standing up or otherwise don't want to use the mouse. The left/right arrow keys navigate between questions, and the up/down arrow keys (or spacebar) show/hide the answer. "+" and "-" mark the question as correct or incorrect.</p>
