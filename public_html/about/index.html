			<h4 class="header">What is RulesGuru?</h4>

				<div class="content">
				<p>RulesGuru is a searchable database of <b>Magic: The Gathering</b> rules questions that anyone can contribute to. With an ever-expanding and constantly-updated question pool, you can find everything from the easiest Standard questions to the most complicated of corner cases here.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Each question is extensively tagged and categorized, allowing you to tailor the questions you're given to your exact purpose. The available filters include difficulty, format legality, cards used in the question, and the area of the rules that's being asked about. Detailed descriptions of each filter can be found by hovering over the appropriate section of the sidebar accessible in the upper left of the <a href="..">home page</a>.</p>
				<br>
				<p>We also have a <a href="https://discord.gg/Mwknxg3drr">Discord server</a> for discussion of Magic's rules.</p>

			<h4 class="header">Questions about Questions?</h4>

				<div class="content">
					<p>Player names that start with "A" are the active player. Player names that start with any other letter are nonactive players. (In multiplayer the names will start with "B", "C", "D" etc to indicate turn order.) If the question spans multiple turns, the players' names do not change as new turns begin.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Questions will always refer to an object by its original name, regardless of any changes caused by game effects. For example if a Clone enters the battlefield and copies Grizzly Bears, the question will still refer to it as "Clone" in order to distinguish it from the original Grizzly Bears.</p>

			<h4 class="header">Want to Help?</h4>

			<div class="content">
				<p>RulesGuru functions similarly to a wiki, in that anyone can contribute to the data that's available for everyone else. With the community's help the question pool can be as large as possible and include questions about new cards as soon as they're spoiled. You can easily submit questions of your own by heading <a href="../submit">here</a> and typing in your question. Once submitted, questions will be reviewed for accuracy by our team of admins and then approved into the site database.</p>
				<br>
				<p>If you're interested in joining our admin team, we'd love to have you. See <a class="inline" href="../get-involved">here</a> for more information.</p>
